# The-new-method-in-java-to-print-subsequence-with-less-time-complexibility-memory
Generating all unique subsequences of a string with duplicates.
This recursive algorithm was discovered by Himanshu Raj on October 2025 a IIT gn student .
It deduplicates subsequences naturally using recursion without a HashSet.
Its time complexibilty is very low if duplicate characters occurs in string and same ad hashset method and uses less memory.
